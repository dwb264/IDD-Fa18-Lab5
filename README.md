# Useless Box

*A lab report by Devon Bain*

## 3D Printing

**a. Include a photo of your printed part here.**

**b. Include `.stl` or `.svg` files for your bopper, if 3d-printing.**

I used laser cutting to make the bopper. See below for images and links.

I used the first piece of provided code to test the switch: [Link to code](scripts/switch-test/switch-test.ino)

## Putting it All Together

Include here:

1. Your Arduino code.

I made two main changes to the code: first, I added a delay of one second before the bopper flips the switch. Second, I incremented the servo position with a loop when the bopper is coming up, rather than flipping immediately to the other position, because this prevented the box lid from getting stuck.

1. `.stl` or `.svg` files for your "bopper" â€” if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.

I used laser-cutting to make the bopper. It consists of a curved arm connected to the servo, which I placed on the bottom of the box, and a flat piece that pushes against the switch.

The final pattern I used looks like:

I prototyped different shapes and curvatures with cardboard before cutting the final design with a stronger material - acrylic.

For the attached part that pushes the switch, I cut both a round and square piece, but found that both in combination actually worked best.
